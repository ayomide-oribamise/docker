# docker

This repository provides a collection of subfolders, each containing Docker deployment examples for various applications.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from the official website: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
docker-deployment-examples/
|-- app1/
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- Dockerfile
|   |-- package.json
|   |-- src/
|       |-- app.js
|-- app2/
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- Dockerfile
|   |-- requirements.txt
|   |-- src/
|       |-- app.py
|-- ...
|-- README.md
```

Each application subfolder (`app1`, `app2`, etc.) contains a complete Docker deployment example. The subfolder structure helps you find relevant examples quickly.

## How to Use

1. **Choose an Application**: Navigate to the subfolder corresponding to the application you want to deploy.

2. **Follow the README**: Open the `README.md` file in the subfolder to access detailed deployment instructions, explanations, and tips specific to the application.

3. **Build and Run**: Inside each subfolder, you'll find the necessary files, such as Dockerfiles, configuration files, and application codes (located in the src/ folder), to build and run the Docker containers.

4. **Explore and Experiment**: Feel free to explore the examples, modify them to suit your needs, and experiment with different deployment scenarios.
